        Hovstad.<br>By all means, Mr. Mayor. I am at your service. But let me relieve you of your—(takes 
        STOCKMANN's hat and stick and puts them on a chair). Won't you sit down?<br><br>

        Peter Stockmann.<br>(sitting down by the table). Thank you. (HOVSTAD sits down.) I have had an extremely 
        annoying experience to-day, Mr. Hovstad.<br><br>

        Hovstad.<br> Really? Ah well, I expect with all the various business you have to attend to—<br><br>

        Peter Stockmann.<br> The Medical Officer of the Baths is responsible for what happened today.<br><br>

        Hovstad. <br>Indeed? The Doctor?<br><br>

        Peter Stockmann.<br> He has addressed a kind of report to the Baths Committee on the subject of certain 
        supposed defects in the Baths.<br><br>

        Hovstad. <br>Has he indeed?

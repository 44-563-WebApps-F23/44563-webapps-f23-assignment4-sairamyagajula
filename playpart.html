<pre>
<p><h4>Hovstad.</h4>By all means, Mr. Mayor. I am at your service. But let me relieve you of your—(takes 
STOCKMANN's hat and stick and puts them on a chair). Won't you sit down?</p>

<p><h4>Peter Stockmann.</h4><p>(sitting down by the table).</p>Thank you. (HOVSTAD sits down.) I have had an extremely 
annoying experience to-day, Mr. Hovstad.</p>
    
<p><h4>Hovstad.</h4>Really? Ah well, I expect with all the various business you have to attend to—</p>

<p><h4>Peter Stockmann.</h4>The Medical Officer of the Baths is responsible for what happened today.</p>

<p><h4>Hovstad.</h4>Indeed? The Doctor?</p>

<p><h4>Peter Stockmann.</h4>He has addressed a kind of report to the Baths Committee on the subject of certain 
supposed defects in the Baths.</p>

<p><h4>Hovstad.</h4>Has he indeed?</p>

<p><h4>Peter Stockmann.</h4>Yes—has he not told you? I thought he said—</p>

<p><h4>Hovstad.</h4>Ah, yes—it is true he did mention something about—</p>

<p><h4>Aslaksen</h4><p>(coming from the printing-room).</p>I ought to have that copy.</p>

<p><h4>Hovstad</h4><p>(angrily).</p>Ahem!—there it is on the desk.</p>

<p><h4>Aslaksen</h4><p>(taking it).</p>Right.</p>

<p><h4>Peter Stockmann.</h4>But look there—that is the thing I was speaking of!</p>

<p><h4>Aslaksen.</h4>Yes, that is the Doctor's article, Mr. Mayor.</p>
